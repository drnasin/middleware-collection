### About
Personal collection of PSR-7 middleware classes from various REST API projects I've worked on.
Also included are Exceptions they use.

If you need any help I'll be glad to do so. Just use the "Issues" tab...


### Requirements
php > 7.1

for php < 7.1 - restructure the "catch" block to be compatible with php < 7 and you're good to go
